# Micro Grid Test Bed



THIS FIRMWARE REPO IS INTENDED TO SERVE AS THE CONTROLLING SOFTWARE FOR 
A SMART REMOTE CONTROLLED WATER HEATER WITH VARIABLE SETPOINT, OFFSETS, 
AND MANIPULATEABLE STATES (DISABLE/ENABLE)



- TESTED ON AN ATMEGA2560, XBEE REV 2, AVR-GCC, AND AVR-DUDE USING AN ARDUINO PROGRAMER
- CURRENTLY TESTING ON AN AVR ATMEGA 88PA-PU


- USART Library for serial I/O with the AVR ATMEGA 2560
	- formatted print functionality through uprintf()

- Dallas One Wire Library
	- Used for the temperature sensor probe
	- serial communication and floating point conversions for the sensor

- GNU Makefile
	- supports builds with multiple source files
	- specify device, location, ISP model, and sources


 - DIRECTIONS FOR WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS
	TRANSMISSION BAUDRATE = 19200
	- FRAME DETAILS:
		- 16-BIT ADDRESS
		- DEFAULT RECEIVER ADDRESS = 0x0001
		- CHECK COMMANDS LIST FOR AVAILABLE COMMANDS
		- APPEND THE DELIMITER DEFINED IN XBEE_LIB.h ~ 0x2D
	- EXAMPLE:
		- IN ORDER TO CHANGE THE SETPOINT TEMPERATURE TO 5 DEGREES CELSIUS 
			- BYTE 1: 0xBB	= CHANGE SETPOINT COMMAND --> COMMAND TO BE SENT
			- BYTE 2: 0x05 = 5 DEGREES CELSIUS --> ARGUMENT TO FIRST BYTE
			- BYTE 3: 0x2D = EOP -->'END OF PACKET' MESSAGE
	
  - REPURPOSING INSTRUCTIONS
	- REDEFINE STATES IN main.c
	- REDEFINE THE PRIVATE driver LIBRARY FUNCTIONS FOR CORRECT REAL-WORLD OUTPUT
	- REDFINE STATE DEFINITIONS AND STRUCTURES IN fsm.h
	- REDEFINE SensorResult() IN driver.c/h TO PROVIDE THE CORRECT NEXT STATE
